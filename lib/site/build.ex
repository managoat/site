  Renders every page to `dist/` and copies the assets beside them.

  A page is a path, the template that renders it, and the title and
  description its card carries; the table is the one the app's
  `MarketingController` used to hold, one clause per action. Output file
  names follow the served path with `.html` appended (`/launch` →
  `launch.html`) and `/` is `index.html`, which is the shape `nginx.conf`'s
  `try_files` serves without a redirect.
