  The homepage's section mark: a short accent rule and a one-word label.

  The page is ten sections of argument and every one of them used to open with

  The homepage's build sequence: three document annotations, apply, then call.

  The first three beats annotate one `---`-separated manifest. Keeping their
  source as individual documents lets each annotation stay attached to the
  document it explains while `apply_example/0` renders the file the reader
  actually writes.

  `nil` for `:n` is the connector, which is unnumbered because applying the
  file is not one of the three templates and is not the call either.

  Every key in the YAML is one the CLI reads. `manifest.go` decodes a
  `---`-separated file document by document, and `fountain apply` reconciles
  these three kinds and no others (`docs/cli.md`). `op://` is a documented
  secret-manager reference, which is what lets the manifest be committed
  rather than carry a plaintext token on a public page.

  The Agent is named `reviewer` because that is the agent `sdk_example/0`
  starts in the last beat. Renaming it here means renaming it there.

  The Vault beat says what the record is, when to attach it, and that it is
  optional. The collision with HashiCorp is stated once on this page, in the
  "Whose token does it push with?" card below, where the longer distinction
  belongs.

  # Every one is a real deployment against the hosted instance, and every one
  # is open source, so a card carries two links and the page carries no claim
  # that cannot be clicked. The controller test asserts both are absolute and
  # that no app is listed twice.
  #
  # The first group holds the three flagship apps, and they lead every page
  # that shows the roster. An app in it carries a `:flagship` key holding the
  # lines its featured cards add: a short homepage description, what it is
  # like, and who it is for. That key is what `flagship_apps/0` selects on, so
  # the tier is a property of the entry rather than a second list to keep in
